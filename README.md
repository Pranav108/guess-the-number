## Project Description 📑

- This is a simple number guessing game that I created as my e-Litmus Internship task.
- We need to guess a number in a range _**1-N(N depends on level)**_.
- We have the _**25**_ chances to guess the correct number.
- We'll win on guessing the correct number within given chances else we lose.
- If we score higher than before then it'll become high score(HighScore will reset tio zero on each level).
- If our average score of 5 game is greater then the minimum score then level will be automatically uppgraded.

## Tech Stack 💻

- **Vanilla Javascript**
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**

## Optimizations 📊

**1. Refactors:**
Arranged and grouped all the _variables_, _selectors_, _functions_ and _event listeners_ together.

**2. Performance improvement:** 📈
Created _functions_ for the _repetitive code_ & _specific tasks_.
